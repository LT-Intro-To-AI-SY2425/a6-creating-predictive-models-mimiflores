# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
This model is more effective than the model I created in the previous lesson because it shows the training data, testing data, and the predictions. Also, training the data is helpful for seeing how accurate the model actually is. 

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
62.6% of the variation in blood pressure can be explained by the linear relationship with age. 


3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
I think based on the data given, I would say that my model was accurate based on te resuts of the three tests performed. However, I still would not say it is accurate for real-world application. The two predictions for the lower ages of 17 and 20 had a very small margin of error but it was noticeably greater for the age of 56. I think if more data was available to train this model I would be more comfortable assessing how accurate it actually is.
