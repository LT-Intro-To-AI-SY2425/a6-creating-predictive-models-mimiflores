# Part 5 - Unsupervised Learning Writeup

After completing `a6_part5.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.
I would classify the red group as frugal as they spend the least amount and have the least annual income. In contrast, the blue group would be shopaholics because they have the greatest income and spending. The orange group would be classified as average spenders because they have around the median for annual income and spending. I would classify the purple group as careless spenders as they spend as much as the shopaholics even though they have a low annual income and the green group as careful spenders as they have a high annual income but do not spend much. 
2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?
A customer who has a medium income and low spending habits would be in the average spenders group. 
3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?
A cluster of interest to me is the careless spenders group becuase I feel like that is the group I fall into. I think the marketing team could basically advertise any type of sale and use any wording indicated it is the last chance for a deal like this in order to get them to make purchases.
